# Deployment Fix

This commit removes the conflicting GitHub Actions workflow that was trying to deploy to Fly.io.
Railway will now handle deployments automatically when code is pushed to the main branch.

## Changes Made:
1. Disabled fly-deploy.yml workflow
2. Railway deployment will be triggered automatically
3. All environment variables are configured in Railway dashboard
